    "The data we'll use for the Fall 2024 STA130 course project is based on the [Canadian Social Connection Survey](https://casch.org/cscs) (CSCS) run by [genwell](https://genwell.ca/) and the [Canadian Alliance for Social Connection and Health](https://casch.org/) (CASCH). This data is used to produce [Rapid Evidence Briefs](https://casch.org/publications) which scientifically analyze the importance of social connection and community engagement -- relationships with family, friends, coworkers, neighbours, and strangers -- for personal health and well-being. The purpose of our course project is to help raise awareness about and interest in this often under appreciated topic. To do so STA130 students will do \"data blitz\" to discover interesting information and identify key statistics hidden inside the CSCS data. The findings each project team produces will be shared with other UofT courses (in Digital Humanities, Writing, Sociology, etc.) and other genwell and CASCH associated teams specializing in communications and media relations, and they will transform the most interesting findings of our teams into content for social media campaigns. If our findings are important enough, they may even form the basis of future Rapid Evidence Briefs...\n",
    "\n",
    "> In conjunction with this project, we are taking part in a research project \"investigating the impact of community engaged learning on student happiness, satisfaction, and well-being\" (alongside multiple courses in Pharmacology and Toxicology, Human Biology, and Psychology). We are curious to know if this project gives you a sense of engagement and contribution to our broader Canadian community, and how this potential possibility to express your altruistic tendencies turn might influence your own experience in the course and in your own personal life. So, we're exploring data investigating \"the importance of social connection and community engagement\" while at the same time exploring the relevance and impact of this course project activity to our own sense of \"connection and community engagement\" and it's potential benefits to \"personal health and well-being\". \n",

Summary statistics, visualizations, group comparisons, and associations and classification are all likely to be useful in the searching through the CSCS survey dataset to see what it tells us about social connection and well-being. As also described above, this project additionally gives STA130 students an opportunity to \"give back\" by contributing to a meaningful effort to understand key factors that contributed to improved personal health. STA130 students are likely to be able to intuitively understand and explore many of the variables as they work to identify key findings in the CSCS survey datasets and provide the initial analyses that could be the seeds of social media campaigns presenting findings that genwell wants to share with the public.\n",

    "### Canadian Statistical Literacy Poster Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to [Dr. Bethany White](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/bethany-white) who has pointed us to the [ISLP National Competition](https://islp.ssc.ca/), STA130 students have the potential to immediately engage in an opportunity that extends beyond the context of STA130. To see the requirements for participation, click \"Register\" or \"How to Participate\" on [https://islp.ssc.ca](https://islp.ssc.ca). The formatting of the submission for the competition is non-trivially different than what is submitted for the course project in the context of STA130, but there is time for this with an initial deadline associated with this opportunity of December 31, 2024; and a final deadline of February 28th, 2025. \n",
    "\n",
    "Engaing in research early on (as a first-year student) can be very challenging given the limited number of relevant opportunities and the strong competition for these roles. Therefore, students need to begin preparing their resumes and experiences to justify their appropriateness for selection for research opportunities.  The STA130 course projet certainly provides such an example which students should introduce, emphasize, and discuss in order to describe their experience to date in a research capacity. However, even with a well-articulated explanation of your activities and contributions within the \"course project\" context, the experience remains a \"course project\".  The Canadian Statistical Literacy Poster Competition is a way to demonstrate that your work on the STA130 course project is something more. An entry into the competition signals a serious persuit and belief in the work you did for the STA130, and who knows, it might even be nationally recognized. This would certainly make for a very notable indication of a students future research potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this presents yet an even further possibility. In a communication with Prof. Schwartz, Dr. Card indicated that, \"if someone were interested in publishing a paper or something like that [on the basis of the STA130 course project] then ... I could help guide them through. We've had [one paper published by a student](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1660-4601%2F19%2F18%2F11588&data=05%7C02%7Cscott.schwartz%40utoronto.ca%7Cbfa649ec07f34f436bb308dcc212eb8f%7C78aac2262f034b4d9037b46d56c55210%7C0%7C0%7C638598633732842785%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=FPEHQlJRPnbrhacKzI6wgj8xLFbb1ufatUxXIoHNj8A%3D&reserved=0) off this dataset after they worked with it in one of my stats courses so it is certainly feasible!\". As you might have gathered, Dr. Card is a very busy individual; but, if you wanted to attempt to continue to pursue the research you begin as part of the STA130 course project, the first step would be to put together a submssion for the ISLP National Competition. This is the way you can \"message\" and \"signal\" sincere interest in continued engaement in this research that could be taken seriously. You would submit a poster for the ISLP Competition through Prof. Schwartz, and if appropriately Prof. Schwartz would then be able to facilitate a potential connection of a mentorship or collaborative nature with Dr. Card. So, if you're an ambitous student seeking to start putting together a record that could catalyze further research opportunities on the basis of the STA130 course project, [https://islp.ssc.ca](https://islp.ssc.ca) is the place to start... \n",

Student proposals don't necessarily have to be based on three different categories but a diverse proposal considering different approaches to exploring the project dataset likely would be. By Mon Nov04 students will not yet have enountered Mulitple Linear Regression or Decision Tree Classification, but they are welcome to propose analyses based on these methodologies if they are sufficiently familiar with these methodologies to do so sensibly. Students are also encouraged to integrate the considerations of the (recommended but optional) \"Ethical Profesionalism Considerations\" into their proposals.

The \"Current Course Project Capability Level\" section in these HW will remain \"recommended but optional\", but considering these section is much more strongly recommended and only technically optional at this stage. While it's by no means necessary that a Course Project utlilize Mulitple Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classification, it's likely that teams will be able to make \"interesting findings\" relative to the objectives of the Course Project by leveraged these powerful methodologies to better understand the complexities of the data. \n",

Consider, however, who you'd rather be in such a situation: a person who works harder and does more, or a person who isn't actually able to contribute appropriately?

    "    - You may present investigations which led to \"null findings\"; that is, research in which you hypothesized  a key finding which might be present in the data, but for which you in the end did not find sufficient statistical evidence for\n",
    "    - You are not required to use any of the same questions formulated during Individual Proposals, but certainly may; and, ideally those questions and the feedback you received on them will be useful in helping you think about the elements of interesting and meaningful questions for the objectives of the Course Project (and its target audience)\n",
    "\n",
    "- As Dr. Card says, \"The CSCS survey dataset gives students a chance to gain experience with messy, real-world data!\"\n",
    "    - There is a lot of missing data and substructure that must be addressed with some \"data wrangling\" and  \"EDA\" (exploratory data analysis, using plots and summary statistics).\n",
    "    - Many statistical and data science analyses (of confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, regression and/or classification models) will be relevantly applicable to the CSCS survey dataset, but your project should be selective rather than exaustive with your use of methodologies, applying them as tools to support the specific intentions of your research questions. \n",
    "        - Make sure the visualizations and methododologies you choose to use make sense for the questions you are trying to answer! Some of the statistical and data science techniques we've covered in this course are not useful to answer certain research question. Choosing the appropriate tools to answer each of your questions is an important part of this project, the the way you present and visualize your analyzis needs to be tailed to and meaningful for the objectives of the Course Project (and its target audience).\n",
    "                \n",

    "        - You do not need to use all the observations from all the different studies included in CSCS survey dataset; rather, think carefully about the questions your group is exploring, the story you are telling with your analysis, and then focus on the subset of data you need to address your questions. \n",
    "\n",

This would allow you combine your analysis and presentation slides into a single reproducible and sharable \"analysis+slides\" file (which is a big plus when it comes to communicating scientific analyses). We'll (unfortunately) not be attempting to create utilize a reproducible and sharable \"analysis+slides\" for the Fall 2024 STA130 sections (although this may be supported in the future with [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html)); so, as you're creating your slides, you must do the following...\n",

    "### Group Presentation Recording (due Mon Dec02)\n",
    "[This is worth 2 course points, 11% of the project grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Course Project group will record a video summarizing and orienting us to their work. The video must be between 4-6 minutes in length (recorded at normal speed), with mark deductions for your videos outside of these limits. The audience for this presentation is our potential future collaborators\n",
    "- Dr. Kiffer Card\n",
    "- UofT students from courses in Digital Humanities, Writing, Sociology, etc.\n",
    "- and other teams associated genwell and CASCH  \n",
    "all of whom are primarily interested in raising awareness of and interest in the relationship between social connection and well-being. Nonetheless, for our project, your recording summarizing and orienting us to our work can be targetted towards either of the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Interesting findings\" that could form the basis of the content of social media posts as part of the content of social media campaigns\n",
    "2. \"Scientific investigation\" oriented towards forming the foundation foundation upon which a more extensive [Rapid Evidence Brief](https://casch.org/publications) should be developed\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the audience and objectives of the recording, the presentation shouldn't be too technical but rather focus on the reasons why the questions and results are relevant to the collaborator, what they can do with the insights obtained, along with an indication of the nature of the analysis and evidence supporting the conclusions of the team. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recording requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The video must be between 4-6 minutes in length (recorded at normal speed). Each group member must appear in the video and be visably identifiable when speaking (probably through a recorded Zoom session using screen sharing with a sufficiently sized speaker thumbnail). All group members should speak approximately the same amount of time (about 1-1.5 minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the limited time, your assignment is to address the following required elements in your video.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide a brief overview of each research question investigated (and the theme connecting each research question to the overarching project goal)\n",
    "- Then for each research question\n",
    "    - Provide ae dscription and rationale for any new variables that were created or observations that were excluded\n",
    "    - Provide a description of statistical and/or data science methodologies brought to bear on the research question\n",
    "    - Provide an interpretation of the results you obained (even if they are \"null findings\")\n",
    "    - Provde the overall findings and conclusions (across all research questions) produced by your team\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what you will be evaluated on here is the decisions your group makes about what is most important to share in the recording, and how you are able to effectively communicate this information clearly and concisely to the intended audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your \"submitted video\" must be a URL link to your recording stored MyMedia \n",
    "- You URL link must must be accessible without a password\n",
    "- See the instructions [here](link)\n",

    "Course Project groups are required to be available to presenting their work during a one-hour block (out of each two-hour window). Group members must then complete their Individual Poster Fair Project Critiques and Reflection assignments in other other one-hour block. TA evaluations and students completing their Individual Poster Fair Project Critiques and Reflection assignments will follow the 3-minute \"elevator pitch\" plus 5-minute Q&A stucture below.\n",

    "- Groups should allow students and TAs to casually mingle around Course Project Posters, examining and visually inspect the Course Project Posters posters at their leisure. \n",
    "- If requested, the groups should share a prepared 3-minute \"elevator pitch\" describing their Course Project, with priority given to TAs if necessary.\n",
    "- The \"elevator pitch\" should provide the rationale for the chosen research questions and main findings without any details about the analyses.\n",
    "- Groups must then be available to answer follow-up questions for up to 10-minutes, first allowing 5-minutes for the student or TA to examine and consider the Course Project Poster after hearing the \"elevator pitch\", and then having a 5-minute Q&A conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluating TA (who will ideally, but may not be the groups TUT TA) may do some initial visual inspection of the Course Project Poster, then request the (3-minute) \"elevator pitch\" of the project, then may do some additional inspection and consdieration of the Course Project Poster (5-minutes), and will then engage in the Q&A conversation (5-minutes). The TA may choose to assign a single common grade to all individual groups members; but, this is technically an \"individual\" evaluation, ranging from \"0 (the student didn't participate in the \"elevator pitch\" or the Q&A session)\" to \"2 (this student is awesome... we expect to keep seeing great things from them in the future)\".\n",

    "[This is worth 2 course points, 11% of the project grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the Course Project, students will complete one final individual assignment by providing three (3) evaluations (due Wed Dec04 the day after the Project Poster Fair) of course Projects. Two of the evaluations will address other Course Projects, while the remaining evaluation will be based on their own course project (with particular reference to their own contributions within their Course Project relative to the other group members). The evaluations of the two other Course Projects should be structure in the format of \"constructive critical feedback\" which could be made available to the teams being evaluated. The evaluation of your own performance on the course project should be self-reflective and address what you did well and do not do well, and what went well and did not go well regarding teamwork within the group. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the day of the poster fair, you will be assigned a one-hour block of time to be at your poster with your group, and another one-hour block of time for you to circulate to examine and discuss the work of other project groups. In this time, you must visit at least two other groups to create your [evaluations](link). "
