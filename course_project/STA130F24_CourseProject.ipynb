    "The data we'll use for the Fall 2024 STA130 course project is based on the [Canadian Social Connection Survey](https://casch.org/cscs) (CSCS) run by [genwell](https://genwell.ca/) and the [Canadian Alliance for Social Connection and Health](https://casch.org/) (CASCH). This data is used to produce [Rapid Evidence Briefs](https://casch.org/publications) which scientifically analyze the importance of social connection and community engagement -- relationships with family, friends, coworkers, neighbours, and strangers -- for personal health and well-being. The purpose of our course project is to help raise awareness about and interest in this often under appreciated topic. To do so STA130 students will do \"data blitz\" to discover interesting information and identify key statistics hidden inside the CSCS data. The findings each project team produces will be shared with other UofT courses (in Digital Humanities, Writing, Sociology, etc.) and other genwell and CASCH associated teams specializing in communications and media relations, and they will transform the most interesting findings of our teams into content for social media campaigns. If our findings are important enough, they may even form the basis of future Rapid Evidence Briefs...\n",
    "\n",
    "> In conjuction with this project, we are taking part in a reserach project \"investigating the impact of community engaged learning on student happiness, satisfaction, and well-being\" (alongside multiple courses in Pharmacology and Toxicology, Human Biology, and Psychology). We are curious to know if you find this project altruistic, and how this in turn might influece your own experience in the course, and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this data ethically, professionally, and appropriately we must take a quick look and abide by the [data use agreement](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60283c2e174c122f8ebe0f39/t/6239c284d610f76fed5a2e69/1647952517436/Data+Use+Agreement+for+the+Canadian+Social+Connection+Survey.pdf). You should also take a quick look at the [list of available variables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ISVymGn-WR1lcRs4psIym2N3or5onNBi/view) and then check out the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mbUQlMTrNYA7Ly5eImVRBn16Ehy9Lggo/view) itself (available at the bottom of the [CSCS](https://casch.org/cscs) webpage).\n"
