    "1. Use ChatGPT to create a school related simulated dataset for multiple linear regression\n",
    "    1. Ensure ChatGPT provides binary, categorical, and \"continuous\" (`float` or `int`) data columns (very briefly reviewing types)\n",
    "    2. Review simple linear regression using [smf](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/formulas.html) [and not [sm](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/api.html) which we won't use] for continuous and binary predictor variables\n",
    "    3. Introduce multiple linear regression using [smf](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/formulas.html) by \n",
    "        1. using both the continuous and binary variables\n",
    "        2. using a single (non-binary) categorical variable \n",
    "        3. using interaction with the continuous and binary variables\n",
    "        4. using interactions with the continuous and binary and categorical variables\n",
    "    4. Throughout the above demonstrations, show the formulas for multiple linear regression (expanding on the meaning of addition and interaction of _variables_)\n",
    "        1. Discuss the magnitude of an effect and belief in the statistical evidence of an affect\n",
    "        2. Visualize \"best fit lines with interactions\" using `px.scatter` \n",

    "1. **[5 minutes]** Break into 4 groups of 4-6 students and determine 1 person who could serve as a good protagonist for the exercises below. \n",
    "    1. **[10 minutes]** Come up with a story surrounding wanting to predict some outcome (*dependent variable*) about this person using 2 (or more) predictors (*independent variables*) that could be measured about the person. In doing so, the group should consider an interaction constructed from the variables as an additional predictor. \n",
    "      > For example: Good grade (dependent variable) might be affected by length of sleep (independent variable 1), time spent in studying (independent variable 2), and a combination of them (the new factor). \n",
    "      >\n",
    "      > That said, the more outrageous and entertaining the story your group can come up with, the funner it will be to present it to the other groups... humor is a powerful tool that you should try to add to any presentations you give (within reason and where possible)\n",
    "      \n",
    "    2. **[25 minutes]** Present the story (in about 3 minutes per group) to other groups. \n",
    "        1. After each group presents, other groups should vote on whether the variables and interactions are appropiate, with there being about 3 minutes per group to discuss possible improvements to the prediction specification of proposed model\n",

    "> Code and write all your answers in a python notebook (in code and markdown cells) and save your python jupyter notebook in your own account and \"repo\" on [github.com](github.com) and submit a link to that notebook though Quercus for assignment marking.\n",

    "[MOVE QUESTSION 3 HERE AS QUESTION 1 (and reindex the questions)]\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine a company that sells sports equipment. The company runs advertising campaigns on TV and online platforms. The effectiveness of the TV ad might depend on the amount spent on online advertising and vice versa, leading to an interaction effect between the two advertising mediums.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discuss with ChatGPT what the specific (outcome and predictor) variables are in this scenario and whether or not any meaningful interactions between them might need to be taken into account when predicting the outcome. Assuming potential interactions need to be considered, write down two formulas that represent modeling the interaction and not modeling the interaction. Try to write these formulas out (either as pseduomath or pseudocode expression) for yourself rather than just having ChatGPT provide them, but use ChatGPT to help you out if you need to.\n",
    "    1. Explain how to use thse two formluas to make predictions of the outcome, and interact with ChatGPT to help you write (draft, edit, and finalize) a high level explaination of why predictions from a model with an interaction are different than predictions from a model without an interaction. \n",
    "    2. Instead of considering an interaction between two continuous variables, consider an interaction between one of the continuous variales and a binary version of the other continuous variable which gets categorized as either simply having either a \"low\" or \"high\" numeric value; then, give an interpretation of the different predictions made by the interaction formula.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Find an interesting data set online for the scenario above, or for some other scenario in which you can analogously consider modeling interactions between continuos and indicator variables. Feel free to use help from ChatGPT wherever helpful for any part of this question.\n",
    "    1. Use `px.scatter` to plot \"best fit lines\" that show the observed effect of the interaction between a binary variable and a continuous variable under consideration, and describe in simple terms what the observed effect of the interaction appears to be\n",
    "    2. Use [smf](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/formulas.html) to fit an interaction model for your data and interpret what the statistical analysis of the model suggests regarding the evidence for the relevance of the interaction \n",
    "    3. Hypothetically supposing there was not sufficient evidence the relevance of the interaction, illustrate the approriate response through demonstration by providing an adjusted version of model specification and fit \n",
    "    4. Discuss if and how this \"model building\" process could be further applied to the remaining variables in the model specification\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Discuss with ChatGPT the differences between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression and summarize your preference for one or the other and your rationale for this preference [MOVE THIS TO QUESTSION 1 (and reindex the questions)]\n",
    "    1. Discuss with ChatGPT the differences between using continuous variables, indicator variables, and interactions variables in multiple linear regression models, and succinctly summarize these distinctions in your own words\n",
    "    2. Discuss with ChatGPT the difference in how binary variables and non-binary categorical variables are encoded when used in multiple linear regression models, and explain in your own words what a \"baseline group\" is and why we use only \"number of categories minus one\" indicator variables for categorical variables in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ask ChatGPT whether the following OLS result shows a good fit, and extend your study on R-squared, F-statistic, AIC and BIC, and Coefficients and P-values. Try explaining in your own words how does each suggests a strong or a weak fit.\n",
