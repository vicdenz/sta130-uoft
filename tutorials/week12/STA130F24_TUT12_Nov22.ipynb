    "> Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that can cause severe health problems if not treated early. Early symptoms are often nonspecific and can mimic less severe viral illnesses, making accurate diagnosis necessary. A healthtech company has developed a predictive machine learning model intended to assist doctors in diagnosing Lyme disease based on symptoms, history of tick exposure, and initial blood tests. The model was tested in a clinical trial involving patients suspected of having Lyme disease based on their symptoms and exposure history. \n",
