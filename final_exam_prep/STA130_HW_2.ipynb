    "At the time it departed from England in April 1912, the RMS Titanic was the largest ship in the world. In the night of April 14th to April 15th, the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank approximately 600km south of Newfoundland (a province in eastern Canada). Many people perished in this accident. Data about the passengers who were on board the Titanic at the time of the accident is available in the \"titanic.csv\" file."
