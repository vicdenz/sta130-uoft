A \"sampling distribution\" can be derived theoretically in some cases; or, simulated by resampling from the population (if it's available) over and over (and recalculating the statistic in each sample and visualing the distribution of these \"sampled\" statistics). What we're doing in this problem is creating what should should be referred to as a \"bootstrap sampling distribution of proportions\", wherein we presume the sample we have is sufficiently representative of the population to allow us to proceed by using it as such: the sample then \"replaces\" the population with us pretending that it is a suitable stand in placeholder for the population. \n",
