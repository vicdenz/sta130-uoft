    "1.1 **Null Hypothesis of \"No Effect\"**  \n",
    "In this analysis, the null hypothesis assumes that the new vaccine has **no significant effect** on the health of the individuals. This means, on average, there is no improvement in health scores before and after vaccination.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 **Data Visualization**  \n",
    "To investigate the effect of the vaccine, we compared the **health score improvement** (Final Health Score - Initial Health Score) for each individual. I used **bootstrapping** to generate a distribution of sample means for this health improvement data. The graph visualizes the distribution of these bootstrapped means, with lines marking the sample mean, the 95% confidence interval (CI), and the standard error of the mean (SE).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 **Methodology Code and Explanations**  \n",
    "We used a **bootstrap method** to resample the health improvement data 1000 times, calculating the mean of each resample to create a distribution of sample means. This allowed us to compute the **standard deviation** and **standard error** of the means, as well as to construct a **95% confidence interval**. The key calculations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Mean:** The average of the bootstrapped means.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:** Measures the spread of the bootstrapped means.\n",
    "- **Standard Error (SE):** Estimates the variability in the sample mean.\n",
    "- **95% Confidence Interval:** The range within which we expect the true population mean to lie, with 95% confidence.\n",

    "2.2 **Supporting Visualizations**  \n",
    "The graph includes a histogram of the bootstrap means along with vertical lines representing:\n",
    "- The **mean** of the bootstrapped means.\n",
    "- The **95% confidence interval** (lower and upper bounds).\n",
    "- The **standard error** above and below the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Findings and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 **Conclusion Regarding Null Hypothesis of \"No Effect\"**  \n",
    "The 95% confidence interval for the health score improvement does not include zero, suggesting that there is evidence to **reject the null hypothesis**. This implies that the vaccine likely has a positive effect on the health of individuals who received it, resulting in a measurable improvement in health scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 **Further Considerations**  \n",
    "While the results indicate that the vaccine is effective, further analysis could explore different population segments (e.g., by age or gender) to investigate if the effect varies across subgroups. Additionally, larger sample sizes and more robust clinical trials could help validate these findings in a broader population.\n"
